                <h3>World Cup Informer for many Clients - Based on TCP Server (Using Java & C++)</h3>
                <p>A World Cup update system employs a TCP Server, implemented in Java and C++, to serve multiple clients. Utilizing STOMP, a Thread-Per-Client architecture, and the Reactor module, the server relays live game events like goals and halftime to clients while also enabling them to submit game reports. This real-time information exchange enhances user engagement and interaction during the World Cup.</p>

                <p>Designed an application to match the perfect foods with the unique needs of IBD patients, addressing the challenge of limited data in this field. The heart of our application is a data-gathering module, where users input their daily experiences over several days. They report symptoms like the frequency of bathroom visits, their sleep patterns, and any discomfort or complications they may be facing.</p>
