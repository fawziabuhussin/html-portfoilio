                <h3>World Cup Informer for many Clients - Based on TCP Server (Using Java & C++)</h3>
                <p>A World Cup update system employs a TCP Server, implemented in Java and C++, to serve multiple clients. Utilizing STOMP, a Thread-Per-Client architecture, and the Reactor module, the server relays live game events like goals and halftime to clients while also enabling them to submit game reports. This real-time information exchange enhances user engagement and interaction during the World Cup.</p>
